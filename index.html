<h3><a href='https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula' target="_blank">Dragula</a> in action.</h3>

<div class='examples'>


  <div class='parent'>
    <p>This is an example of the copying feature of Dragula. The problem with this setup is twofold: we are unable to re-arrange the items in the right-hand column, and the left-hand column accepts elements (which seems like an unnecessary feature for the kind of product I have in mind). </p>
    <div class='wrapper'>
      <div id='le' class='container'>
        <div>When elements are copyable, they can't be sorted in their origin container</div>
        <div>Copying prevents original elements from being dragged. A copy gets created and <em>that</em> gets dragged instead</div>
        <div>Whenever that happens, a <code>cloned</code> event is raised</div>
      </div>
      <div id='ri' class='container'>
        <div>Note that the clones get destroyed if they're not dropped into another container</div>
        <div>You'll be dragging a copy, so when they're dropped into another container you'll see the duplication.</div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>This will enable copying:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        dragula([document.getElementById('le'), document.getElementById('ri')], {
          copy: true
        });
      </code>
    </pre>

  </div>

</div> <!-- end of "examples" div -->
